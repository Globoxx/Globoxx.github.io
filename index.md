### Want to eat a beef burger?
!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ADD FAIL RATE BY BURGER FRANCHISE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
If we're looking at McDonald's, Burger King and Wendys, we want to choose one of them to have a good american burger. The question is which one to choose? One can say that it depends on the people preference. Let's answer this question by looking at the safety of each restaurant without taking into account the taste of each burgers. In function of the year, the safest restaurant varies but nowadays, Burger king is the winner of this problem.
